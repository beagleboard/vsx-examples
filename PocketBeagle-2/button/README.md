# Button Example

## Goal

Wait for button press on `P2.33` (i.e. Left Button on TechLab Cape).

## Overview

This example demonstrates using Beagle Helper library to detect button press in PocketBeagle 2.

## Challenges

1. Can you modify the example to use other button (Right button in TechLab Cape)?
2. Can you demonstrate difference between waiting for press vs waiting for release in case of Button?
