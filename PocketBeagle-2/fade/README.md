# Fade

## Goals

Demonstrate fading an LED in and out using PWM.

## Overview

[Pulse-width modulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation) is any method of representing a signal as a rectangular wave with a varying duty cycle. It can be used to for controlling the average power or amplitude delivered by an electric signal.

## Challenges

1. Can you modify the program to drive the LED at 50% duty cycle?
2. Can you try out using other time periods?
