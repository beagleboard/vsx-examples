# Seven Segments Example

## Goal

Demonstrate 2 seven segments on TechLab Cape.

## Overview

A seven-segment display is a form of electronic display device for displaying decimal numerals that is an alternative to the more complex dot matrix displays. At the most basic level, it is a collection of 7 LEDs, which can be controlled individually to produce basic letters and numerals.

This example needs superuser permissions. 

## Challenges

1. Can you modify the example to display your name?
2. Can you combine the two seven segments to display 2 letters of your name at a time?
3. Can you modify the example to display 60 second countdown?
