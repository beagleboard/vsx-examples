# Light Sensor

## Goal

Using the light sensor to detect wheather the room is light or dark.

## Overview

[Photodiode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodiode) is a semiconductor diode sensitive to photon radiation. It produces an electrical current when it absorbs photons. This can be used to detect the amount of light in terms of voltage.

## Challenges

1. Can you adjust threshold value in a way to be more suitable for detecting only direct light?
